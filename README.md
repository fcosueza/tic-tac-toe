# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game build with ReactJS as part of
[reactjs.org tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

# TODO

Features to be added for completing the tutorial and some other extras added by me:

1. ~~Display de location of each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.~~
2. ~~Bold the current selected item in the move list.~~
3. ~~Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hard coding them.~~
4. ~~Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.~~
5. ~~when someone wins, highlight the tree squares that cause the win.~~
6. ~~When no one wins, display a message about the result being draw.~~
7. ~~Split code in components~~.
8. ~~Refactor code to use functional components instead classes~~
9. ~~Add test~~
10. Refactor some test (they look a little bit ugly...)
